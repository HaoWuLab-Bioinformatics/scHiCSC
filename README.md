# scHiCSC
## Introduction
scHiCSC is a novel single-cell Hi-C clustering framework by contact-weight-based smoothing and feature fusion.It achieves a good and stable clustering effect in the datasets with large-scale cell numbers and can cluster the cells whose number is very small in the whole dataset.

## Overview

 As shown in Fig. 1, the scHiCSC framework consists of three crucial steps: cell embedding generation,feature fusion, and spectral clustering.In this framework, we propose a new smoothing approach based on contact number weight, and construct cell embedding sequentially by a random walk with restart smoothing. Furthermore, we present a new feature fusion approach to achieve the cell embedding created in the preceding stage and generate a feature fusion matrix. Finally, the spectral clustering algorithm is used to achieve cell clustering.

## Usage
### Smooth chromosome contact matrices
scHiCSC proposes smoothing based on contact number weight and random walk with restart to impute the chromosome contact matrices for each cell and each chromosome separately. Thus you can run the script as:

``` python './626cells/Module1.py' ```  or ``` python './2655cells/Module1.py'```

### Feature fusion and Clustering
After imputation, scHiCSC proposes a new feature fusion approach to achieve the cell embedding and generate a feature fusion matrix. Finally, scHiCSC uses the spectral clustering algorithm to achieve cell clustering.You can run the script as:

``` python './626cells/Module2.py' ```  or ``` python './2655cells/Module2.py'```
