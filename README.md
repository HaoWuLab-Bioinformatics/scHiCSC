# scHiCSC
## Introduction
scHiCSC is a novel single-cell Hi-C clustering framework by contact-weight-based smoothing and feature fusion.It achieves a good and stable clustering effect in the datasets with large-scale cell numbers and can cluster the cells whose number is very small in the whole dataset.

## Dependency
Python 3.6   
keras  2.3.1  
sklearn  
numpy  
mlxtend  
h5py 

### Installing scHiCStackL:
Download the zip file of the scHiCStackL project, and install the python package through the following one of the two methods:

(1)Install the python package through setup.py

```python
python setup.py install
```

(2)Install the python package through the whl file

```python
pip install scHiCStackL-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl
```

#### Import scHiCStackL

```python
import scHiCStackL.scHiCStackL as sc
```

We provide PCA files generated by ML1 and ML3, Ramani and Flyamer datasets (processed by Kernel Principal Component Analysis) and stacking_model method.

(1)Evaluate the prediction performance of scHiCStackL on ML1 and ML3 datasets (The range of recommended parameter ndim is [40, 50]):

```python
ARI, Acc, MCC, F1, Precision, NMI = sc.stackling_model(cell_type="human", cell_num = 626, ndim = 40)
```

(2)Evaluate the prediction performance of scHiCStackL on the whole Ramani dataset (The range of recommended parameter ndim is [40, 50]):

```python
ARI, Acc, MCC, F1, Precision, NMI = sc.stackling_model(cell_type="human", cell_num = 2655, ndim = 40)
```

(3)Evaluate the prediction performance of scHiCStackL on the Flyamer dataset (The range of recommended parameter ndim is [40, 50]):

```python
ARI, Acc, MCC, F1, Precision, NMI = sc.stackling_model(cell_type="mouse", cell_num = 178, ndim = 40)
```
